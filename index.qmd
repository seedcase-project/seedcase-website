::: {#hero-heading}
The Seedcase Project is a value-driven initiative focused on open
science and open-source software. We believe that developing open-source
software and offering researchers training in technical skills and
knowledge can improve health and well-being research. This includes
tasks related to building, managing, and sharing health data.
:::

## Our goals

The Seedcase Project is more than software, it is also about education,
training, and the code itself.

::::::: {.grid .wider-grid}
::: {.g-col-6 .g-col-md-3 .landing-page-card}
### Develop open-source software for health data

Software that is open-source and targeted to diverse users, like health
research organizations and small-to-medium sized companies.
:::

::: {.g-col-6 .g-col-md-3 .landing-page-card}
### Create training material and run workshops

Specifically training on technical skills such as software and data
engineering, while following open scientific practices.

### Build and nurture an inclusive community

A community that is open and inclusive that shares knowledge, learnings,
and better practices in research data engineering and software
engineering.

### Lead by example

By building this project as fully open as possible and applying the same
principles we teach and advocate for.

## Software products

Even though Seedcase Project is still a work in progress, we have a
clear vision on the software weâ€™re building.

Seedcase will take you from structuring and documenting your data, being
able to browse and share it, to tending to projects using the data.

We plan to create four software products that run both separately and
together:

-   [**sprout**](https://github.com/seedcase-project/seedcase-sprout):
    Grow your data in a structured and healthy way

-   **propagate**: Submit requests for accessing specific data from a
    data package[^1]

-   **flower**: Catalogue and browse metadata on data in a data package

-   **garden**: Tend to multiple projects using data from a data
    package

[^1]: [Data packages](https://datapackage.org/) are central structures in the Seedcase ecosystem,
    specifically when it comes to the structure of metadata. See our
    [decision post](https://decisions.seedcase-project.org/why-frictionless-data/) on why
    we structure data and metadata this way.
