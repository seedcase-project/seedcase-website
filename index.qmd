::: {#hero-heading}
The Seedcase Project is a value-driven initiative focused on open
science and open-source software. We believe that developing open-source
software and offering researchers training in technical skills and
knowledge can improve health and well-being research. This includes
tasks related to building, managing, and sharing health data.

## Software products

::::: grid
::: g-col-8
Even though Seedcase Project is still a work in progress, we have a
clear vision on the software weâ€™re building.

Seedcase will take you from structuring and documenting your data, being
able to browse and share it, to tending to projects using the data.

We plan to create four software products that run both separately and
together:

-   [**sprout**](https://github.com/seedcase-project/seedcase-sprout):
    Grow your data in a structured and healthy way

-   **propagate**: Submit requests for accessing specific data from a
    data package[^1]

-   **flower**: Catalogue and browse metadata on data in a data package

-   **garden**: Tend to multiple projects using data from a data package

[^1]: [Data packages](https://datapackage.org/) are central structures
    in the Seedcase ecosystem, specifically when it comes to the
    structure of metadata. See our [decision
    post](https://decisions.seedcase-project.org/why-frictionless-data/)
    on why we structure data and metadata this way.
