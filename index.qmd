## A value-driven initiative

In the **Seedcase Project**, we're dedicated to open science and
open-source software. We believe that by developing open-source software
and providing researchers with training in technical skills, we can
enhance health and well-being research.

See our [Roadmap](/roadmap/index.qmd) or our [About](about/index.qmd)
page for more information about the project.

## Goals

The Seedcase Project is more than software: It is also about education,
training, and the code itself.

### Develop open-source software for health data

Software that is open-source and targeted to diverse users, like health
research organizations and small-to-medium sized companies.

### Create training material and run workshops

Specifically training on technical skills such as software and data
engineering, while following open scientific practices.

### Build and nurture an inclusive community

A community that is open and inclusive that shares knowledge, learnings,
and better practices in research data engineering and software
engineering.

### Lead by example

By building this project as fully open as possible and applying the same
principles we teach and advocate for.
