## A value-driven initiative

In the **Seedcase Project**, we're dedicated to open science and
open-source software. We believe that by developing open-source software
and providing researchers with training in technical skills, we can
enhance health and well-being research.

See our [Roadmap](/roadmap/index.qmd) or our
[About](about/index.qmd) page for more information about the project,
our values, and our goals.

## Software products

**Seedcase** will take you from structuring and documenting your data,
and being able to browse and share your metadata.

We plan to create multiple software products that run both separately and
together:

### [Sprout](https://sprout.seedcase-project.org/)

Grow your data in a structured and healthy way in a [data
package](https://decisions.seedcase-project.org/why-frictionless-data/)

## Goals

The Seedcase Project is more than software: It is also about education,
training, and the code itself.

### Develop open-source software for health data

Software that is open-source and targeted to diverse users, like health
research organizations and small-to-medium sized companies.

### Create training material and run workshops

Specifically training on technical skills such as software and data
engineering, while following open scientific practices.

### Build and nurture an inclusive community

A community that is open and inclusive that shares knowledge, learnings,
and better practices in research data engineering and software
engineering.

### Lead by example

By building this project as fully open as possible and applying the same
principles we teach and advocate for.
