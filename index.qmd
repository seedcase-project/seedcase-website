## A value-driven initiative

In the **Seedcase Project**, we're dedicated to open science and
open-source software. We believe that by developing open-source software
and providing researchers with training in technical skills, we can
enhance health and well-being research.

See our our [Roadmap](https://community.seedcase-project.org/roadmap) or
[About](about/index.qmd) page for more information about the project,
our values, and our goals.

## Software products

**Seedcase** will take you from structuring and documenting your data,
being able to browse and share it, to tending to projects using the
data.

We plan to create four software products that run both separately and
together:

Grow your data in a structured and healthy way

### Garden

Tend to multiple projects using data from a data package

[^1]: [Data packages](https://datapackage.org/) are central structures
    in the Seedcase ecosystem, specifically when it comes to the
    structure of metadata. See our [decision
    post](https://decisions.seedcase-project.org/why-frictionless-data/)
    on why we structure data and metadata this way.
