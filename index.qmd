## A value-based and principle-driven software development initiative

In the **Seedcase Project**, we don't just develop software. We also
build a culture strongly centered on values and principles. We're
dedicated to open science and open source, and we incorporate this
dedication in nearly all aspects of our work. All of our values and
principles are described on our
[design](https://design.seedcase-project.org/) website.

We believe that by developing open-source software aimed firmly at
solving real and difficult problems in health research, we can improve
the quality of research data and ultimately improve health research.

See our [Roadmap](/roadmap/index.qmd) or our [About](about/index.qmd)
page for more information about the project.

## Goals

The Seedcase Project is more than software: It is also about education,
awareness, and the code itself.

### Develop open-source software for health data

Software that is open-source and targeted to diverse users, like health
research organizations and small-to-medium sized companies.

### Create beginner-friendly documentation

Software is nothing without documentation. We strive to create
documentation that is beginner-friendly, easy to understand, and as
accessible as possible.

### Build and nurture an inclusive community

A community that is open and inclusive that shares knowledge, learnings,
and better practices in research data engineering and software
engineering.

### Lead by example

By building this project as fully open as possible and applying the same
principles we teach and advocate for.
