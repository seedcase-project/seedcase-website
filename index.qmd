## Software that improves research data quality and management

Our primary goal is to build open software solutions that help:

-   Research groups and institutions create and manage high-quality and
    FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) research
    data.
-   Individual researchers to find and (re-)use data more easily for
    their own research.
-   Reduce the time from data generation to scientific dissemination by
    focusing on streamlining and automating the data ingestion,
    processing, storage, and management processes.

See our [Roadmap](/roadmap/index.qmd) for more details on the software
we are building.

## A value-based and principle-driven initiative

In the **Seedcase Project**, we don't just develop software. We also
build a culture strongly centered on values and principles. We're
dedicated to **open science** and **open source**, and we incorporate
this dedication in all aspects of our work. Our values and principles
are described on our [design](https://design.seedcase-project.org/)
website.

We believe that by developing open-source software aimed firmly at
solving real and difficult problems in health research, we can improve
the quality of research data and ultimately improve health research.

See our [Roadmap](/roadmap/index.qmd) or our [About](about/index.qmd)
page for more information about the project.

## Goals

### Develop open-source software for health data

Software that is open-source and targeted to diverse users, like health
research organizations and small-to-medium sized companies.

### Create beginner-friendly documentation

Software is nothing without documentation. We strive to create
documentation that is beginner-friendly, easy to understand, and as
accessible as possible.

### Build and nurture an inclusive community

A community that is open and inclusive that shares knowledge, learnings,
and better practices in research data engineering and software
engineering.

### Lead by example

By building this project as fully open as possible and applying the same
principles we teach and advocate for.
