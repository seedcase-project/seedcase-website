In many fields of science, managing and structuring data in FAIR
(Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) ways can be a major
barrier to fully utilising the data collected from a study. This is
largely a software and training issue, complicated by the fact that
funding is often restricted for this type of work as it is often
undervalued.

In the Seedcase Project, we aim to build software tools that make it
easier to manage and work with data. This repository contains the files
used for our main website,
[seedcase-project.org](https://seedcase-project.org). Check it out for
more information about the project, our values, and the software we are
building.

This project is funded by a grant from the Novo Nordisk Foundation. See
our grant proposal here: [![Grant proposal

We are employed at [Aarhus University](https://www.au.dk/en/) and at the
[Steno Diabetes Center Aarhus](https://www.stenoaarhus.dk/) in the
[Central Denmark Region](https://www.rm.dk/).
