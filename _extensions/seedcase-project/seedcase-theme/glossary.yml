data: |
  Data can mean any piece of information that someone would like to use
  to answer questions. What is considered data (and metadata) is highly dependent
  on people and what they intend to do with information that is collected.
  In the context of Seedcase Sprout, data is any information collected for the
  purposes of doing analyses on them to answer questions. An example might be
  data collected from people participating in a study on health and disease.
data package: |
  A "container" for data that describes a coherent collection of data. It consists
  of two parts: data resources and properties.
data resource: |
  A single piece of data, such as a table or data file, and its properties, included
  in a data package. It contains the actual data, documented following the Data Package
  standard. It consists of the raw data, the data saved in parquet format, as well
  as its properties.
properties: |
  Metadata that describes the entire data package and each of the data resources
  within it. At the package level, the properties include the package name and
  description, contributors, licenses, and more. At the resource level, they describe
  attributes such as the resource name, description, schema, and data fields.
  All properties are stored in `datapackage.json` in the root directory of the package.
