This document describes the core parts of the software, what each of the
"building blocks" are for Seedcase, and how they connect and interact
with one another. This is the "blueprint" for the design of Seedcase, so
it is more detailed than the other design documents but not so detailed
as to be describing actual code. To clarify how much detail each part
will be described in, there are two established terms we use:

-   **Whitebox**: {{< var design.whitebox >}}
-   **Blackbox**: {{< var design.blackbox >}}

The [first section](#level1) covers the overall view of the main parts
inside Seedcase. The [second section](#level2) goes deeper and describes
the contents within each main part, but only as blackboxes.

## Whitebox overall system, Level 1 {#level1}

This section is a high level overview of the internals of Seedcase and
is visually represented with the ["C4
Container"](https://c4model.com/#ContainerDiagram) diagram below. Each
part within the diagram is a blackbox representation of the core
internal parts of Seedcase.

Seedcase.](/design/images/container.png)

| Building Block                 | Description                                                                                   |
|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Web Interface                  | User Interface as a web portal for interacting with the Seedcase-managed Data Resource.       |
| User Authentication            | Managing and controlling who gets access to what sections of the Data Resource.               |
| User and Data Management Layer | The programmatic layer connecting the web interface to the back end environment.              |
| Back End Environment           | This enclosed environment contains the inputted data, admin details, changelog, and raw data. |
| External Secure Server         | The external server where requested data is sent to (only needed if the user requesting access is an external partner).                              |

: Core internal parts of Seedcase (as blackboxes).

This list describes the individual blackbox parts in more detail:

-   **Web Interface**: This is the interface that users will interact with,
    displayed as HTML pages. Different sections of the Web Interface are
    available to different users depending on their permission level
    (for instance, admin users will see more pages related to managing
    data projects).
-   **User Authentication**: This is the part that handles authenticating
    users who log into the Web Portal of the Data Resource instance
    managed by Seedcase. Depending on the user's assigned permissions,
    they will see different pages within the Web Interface.
-   **User and Data Management Layer**: This is the programmatic interface
    that connects the Web Portal to the Back End Environment. While all
    actions will be achieved through the Web Portal, advanced users will
    be able to directly connect to this layer (for instance, through the
    terminal, Python, or R).
-   **Back End Environment**: This enclosed environment will contain the
    database and file storage for the Data Resource. Raw data will be
    stored here, as well as administrative data files such as a listing
    of the data projects.
-   **External Secure Server**: This external system is where requested data
    will be sent to depending on needs of the user.

#### Data catalog

-   Is a list or table with variable name, a brief description, and a
    link to further details that includes the data dictionary entry for
    the variable. The data dictionary would contain basic aggregate
    statistics (like number of missingness, general distribution of the
    data values) as well as a changelog of the variable. Alongside the
    list of variables are buttons to select them for a data request
    application. The variable list or table would be built from the
    underlying set of files that contain the documentation.

#### Data projects

-   The page contains a list of all data projects connected to the Data
    Resource. This would include the title of the project, the name of
    the applicant, and who else will have access to the data, as well as
    a short description written as part of the data project application.
    If the researcher is interested, they should be able to click through
    to a more detailed description of the individual project which will
    display a list of the variables that the data project has been
    granted access to as well as simple aggregations of the variables.

#### Admin management

<!-- TODO: Need a components diagram for this. -->

![user data management](/design/images/user-data-management.png)

These are some potential endpoints for the API. For almost all of them,
there are some overlapping features. For instance, each endpoint accepts
(either as a requirement or optionally):

-   **Authorization (string)**: A security code that is used to authenticate
    the user. This security code should be generated and provided to the
    user when they create an account.

### Back End Environment (whitebox)

The input data will be quite heterogeneous and so the Seedcase backend
will need to be composed of multiple components:

-   Raw data files as plain text
-   Cleaning and processing programming scripts
-   A formal database structure (e.g. SQL), that is ACID (Atomic,
    Consistent, Isolated, and Durable) compliant for data integrity and
    that handles heterogeneous data types
-   A Common Data Model that is standardized and structured for use by
    the database
-   A version control system to track changes to the raw data and
    processing scripts, for recordkeeping, auditing, and transparency
-   A data version numbering system, based on the
    [CalVer](https://calver.org/) style, to help track which data the
    user is working with and to allow for comparison between versions
-   A changelog describing the changes
-   A data dictionary linked to the variables contained in the database,
    modified manually by the users but generated automatically
