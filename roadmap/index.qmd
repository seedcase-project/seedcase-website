This is a high level roadmap for products we want to create in the
Seedcase Project. We do not include timelines or estimates for
completion in this document.

For a more detailed and regularly updated roadmap, see our [Long-term
Planning GitHub
Board](https://github.com/orgs/seedcase-project/projects/22/views/1).

## Product roadmap

This is a non-exhaustive list of products or outputs that we believe can
fill multiple strong needs within the research community. These
products, we believe, have the capacity to substantially improve how
research is done. However, given our current timelines and resources, we
can't complete all of them. We list them here to show our visions and
goals.

They are split into three main categories: software and
software-related, technical documentation, and outreach.

Products are listed in the order that we plan to work on and complete
them. Beside each product is one of the following status icons:

| Status | Description |
|:-----------------------------:|:----------------------------------------|
| {{< var status.done >}} | Products we've completed with a minimally viable product (MVP) that we'll continue to improve and work on. |
| {{< var status.wip >}} | Products we are working on currently. |
| {{< var status.planned >}} | Products we plan to complete within the current funding period (end of 2027). |
| {{< var status.potential >}} | Products we'd like to work on, but probably won't finish within the current funding period (end of 2027) due to limited time and resources, |
| {{< var status.ongoing >}} | Ongoing products without a final release (e.g., not archived or officially published). |

### Software and software-related

Because software development is an ongoing process, software products
are rarely truly "complete". They continue to evolve through updates and
improvements. A product is considered to have reached MVP and "done"
status once its first version is released on an official software
archive (like PyPI for Python packages). If the product gets sufficient
use, it will continue to be tested and refined based on user feedback.

Some of these products are not strictly software, but are designed to
work within software environments, integrate with other workflows, or
support research software and data engineering.

### Technical documentation

Following the [di√°taxis](https://diataxis.fr/) method, we split
documentation into four types: tutorials, how-to guides, reference, and
explanation. Right now, we don't create any tutorials, so only the other
three are listed below. A brief description of these types are expanded
upon in the sections below. These technical documentation products reach
MVP and done status when they are either:

-   Uploaded to an archive like Zenodo (to generate a DOI).
-   Taught to participants in a workshop setting.
-   Uploaded to a software archive (like PyPI) if they are within a
    software product's repository and are executable (the code within
    runs).

#### Tutorials

Tutorials are learning-oriented documentation that includes workshops,
online tutorials, and learning shorts. These will be developed as [open
educational
resources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_educational_resources).

| Status | Learning resource |
|:--------------------------------------------:|:-------------------------|
| {{< var status.potential >}} | Workshop: Introduction to building research software using Python as a solo developer in research environments. |
| {{< var status.potential >}} | Workshop: Iterative project management and development for effective collaboration and work. |
| {{< var status.potential >}} | Workshop: Building research software using Python in a team setting. |

#### How-to guides

How-to guides are goal-oriented documentation that helps the reader get
something specific done. These include how-to guides, usage guides, and
user manuals.

| Status | Guides or manuals |
|:--------------------------------------------:|:-------------------------|
| {{< var status.wip >}} | [`guidebook.seedcase-project.org`](https://guidebook.seedcase-project.org/): Guidebook to doing research software engineering in a team-setting. |
| {{< var status.wip >}} | [`sprout.seedcase-project.org`](https://sprout.seedcase-project.org/docs/guide) usage guide: Using and interacting with `seedcase-sprout`. |
| {{< var status.planned >}} | Flower usage guide: Using and interacting with `seedcase-flower`. |
| {{< var status.planned >}} | Propagate usage guide: Using and interacting with `seedcase-propagate`. |
| {{< var status.planned >}} | Garden usage guide: Using and interacting with `seedcase-garden`. |

#### Reference

Reference material is information-oriented documentation that are
technical descriptions of how things work or why things are done a
specific way. These include reference manuals, API documentation, and
technical specifications, design documentation, as well as documentation
for how we work together, decisions made, or any community contributing
guidelines we have.

::: callout-important
Because of the nature of reference documentation, they don't really have
a "done" status nor do they have clearly defined "endpoints", like
uploading to an archive to generate a DOI. For these reasons, these
products are all classified as "ongoing".
:::

|:--------------------------------------------:|:-------------------------|
| {{< var status.ongoing >}} | [`seedcase-sprout`](https://sprout.seedcase-project.org/docs/reference/): Reference docs for Sprout. |
| {{< var status.ongoing >}} | [`design`](https://github.com/seedcase-project/design): General design principles and patterns for the organisation, teams, software, and data used throughout the Seedcase Project. |
| {{< var status.ongoing >}} | [`team`](https://github.com/seedcase-project/team): Documentation specific to the Seedcase team, like onboarding, common configuration files, and meeting agendas and minutes. |
| {{< var status.ongoing >}} | [`seedcase-website`](https://github.com/seedcase-project/seedcase-website): Main website for the Seedcase Project. |

#### Explanation

Explanation material is understanding-oriented documentation that
focuses on reflection and broadening knowledge or understanding. These
include opinion pieces, explanations, theoretical or thought-provoking
pieces, and outreach materials.

### Outreach and events

These are activities involves engaging with the research community,
mainly through in-person seminars, symposiums, or other events.

::: callout-note
Given the expertise and resources needed for these types of "products"
(e.g. hosting and coordinating people), we will likely not be able to
work on these types of activities in the near future. However, we
believe that they are important for bringing greater awareness to the
research community about the various topics we work on and advocate for.
:::

| Status | Deliverable |
|:--------------------------------------------:|:-------------------------|
| {{< var status.potential >}} | Seminar series: Unmet needs for research data engineering and current challenges in implementation |
| {{< var status.potential >}} | Symposium: Current state of data engineering in research environment |
