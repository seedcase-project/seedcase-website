{{< include /includes/_wip.qmd >}}

This is a very high level roadmap and "wishlist" for products we aim or
want to create and develop in the Seedcase Project. We do not include
timelines or estimates for completion in this document (see note below).
We have a more detailed and regularly updated roadmap that has some
general timelines available on our [Long-term Planning GitHub
Board](https://github.com/orgs/seedcase-project/projects/22/views/1).

::: callout-important
Estimating a timeline can be extremely difficult, as it is dependent on
multiple factors that often can't be predicted or anticipated.
Therefore, and from our experiences on timelines regularly needing to be
updated, we avoid giving specific timelines in this document.

## Product wishlist

This is a non-exhaustive list of products or outputs that we believe
fill multiple strong needs within the research community, especially in
order to remain relevant and competitive in the modern research
landscape. We believe that we have the capability, expertise,
motivation, and passion to complete these products. These products, we
believe, will substantially improve how research will be done in the
future. However, given our current timelines and resources, we can't
complete all of them but we list them here to show our visions and
goals.

They are split into three main categories: software and
software-related, technical documentation, and events. Technical
documentation encompasses more than just usage guides or manuals for
software, but also includes courses, opinion pieces, and outreach
materials.

Products are listed in the order that we would like to work on and aim
to complete them. Beside each product is a status, which is one of the
following:

| Status | Description |
|:-----------------------------:|:----------------------------------------|
| {{< var status.done >}} | Products we have completed a minimally viable product (MVP) of. As products are never truly "done", the "done" status simply indicates that the product is now in a usable state, but that we will continue improving and working on it. |
| {{< var status.wip >}} | Products we are currently working on. |
| {{< var status.planned >}} | Products we plan to work on and aim to complete within the current funding period (end of 2027). |
| {{< var status.potential >}} | Products we are very interested in working on, but given the time and resources, may likely not get to within the current funding period (end of 2027). |
| {{< var status.ongoing >}} | Products that we will continually work on and that don't strictly have a defined endpoint for "done" (e.g. aren't ever released or uploaded to an archive). |

### Software and software-related

Because of the evolving nature of developing software, software products
are rarely "complete", as they continue to be improved on and updated.
The product reaches MVP and done status when we have created its first
release on an official software archive (like PyPI for Python packages).
After the first release of a MVP and if it gets sufficient use, it will
continue to be tested and refined based on user feedback and identified
bugs.

Some of these products are not strictly software, but can be used within
a software environment, can be integrate into other workflows, or are
used to support research software and data engineering.

### Technical documentation

Following the [di√°taxis](https://diataxis.fr/) method to structuring
documentation, documentation is split up into four types: tutorials,
how-to guides, reference, and explanation. A brief description of these
types of documentation are expanded upon in the sections below. These
technical documentation products reach MVP and done status when they are
either:

-   Uploaded to an archive like Zenodo (to generate a DOI).
-   Taught to participants in a course setting.
-   Uploaded to a software archive (like PyPI) if they are within a
    software product's repository and are executable (the code within
    runs).

::::: panel-tabset
#### Tutorials

Tutorials are learning-oriented documentation that includes multi-day
courses, online tutorials, and learning shorts. These will be developed
as [open educational
resources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_educational_resources).

| Status | Learning resource |
|:--------------------------------------------:|:-------------------------|
| {{< var status.wip >}} | [`rostools/git4cats`](https://github.com/rostools/git4cats): üê± Git for Collaborative Teams: An introductory course on using Git and GitHub for team-based collaborative workflows and practices |
| {{< var status.potential >}} | Course: Introduction to building research software using Python as a solo developer in research environments. |
| {{< var status.potential >}} | Course: Iterative project management and development for effective collaboration and work. |
| {{< var status.potential >}} | [`rostools/r-pkg-intro`](https://github.com/rostools/r-pkg-intro): Build research software using R as a solo developer in research environments. |
| {{< var status.potential >}} | Course: Building research software using Python in a team setting. |

: "Wishlist" of learning-type documentation products we are currently
working on, will work on, or hope to work on.

#### How-to guides

How-to guides are goal-oriented documentation that helps the reader get
something specific done. These include how-to guides, usage guides, and
user manuals.

| Status | Guides or manuals |

: "Wishlist" of goal-type documentation products we are currently
working on, will work on, or hope to work on.

#### Reference

Reference material is information-oriented documentation that are
technical descriptions of how things work or why things are done a
specific way. These include reference manuals, API documentation, and
technical specifications, design documentation, as well as documentation
for how we work together, decisions made, or any community contributing
guidelines we have.

::: callout-important
Because of the nature of reference documentation, they don't really have
a "done" status nor do they have clearly defined "endpoints", like
uploading to an archive to generate a DOI. For these reasons, these
products are all classified as "ongoing".
:::

| Status | Information resource |
|:--------------------------------------------:|:-------------------------|
| {{< var status.ongoing >}} | [`seedcase-project/design`](https://github.com/seedcase-project/design): Overall architectural design documentation for Seedcase software. |
| {{< var status.ongoing >}} | [`seedcase-project/team`](https://github.com/seedcase-project/team): Documentation specific to the Seedcase team, like onboarding, common configuration files, and meeting agendas and minutes. |
| {{< var status.ongoing >}} | [`seedcase-project/community`](https://github.com/seedcase-project/community): Content for community building, outreach, and contributing guidelines for the Seedcase Project. |

: "Wishlist" of informational-type documentation products we are
currently working on, will work on, or hope to work on.

#### Explanation

Explanation material is understanding-oriented documentation that
focuses on reflection and broadening knowledge or understanding. These
include opinion pieces, explanations, theoretical or thought-provoking
pieces, and outreach materials.

### Outreach and events

These are activities that would involve engaging with the research
community, mainly through in-person seminars, symposiums, or other
events.

::: callout-note
Given the expertise and resources needed for these types of "products"
(e.g. hosting and coordinating people), we will likely not be able to
work on these types of activities in the near future. However, we
believe that they are important for bringing greater awareness to the
research community about the various topics we work on and advocate for.
:::

| Status | Deliverable |
|:--------------------------------------------:|:-------------------------|
| {{< var status.potential >}} | Seminar series: Unmet needs for research data engineering and current challenges in implementation |
| {{< var status.potential >}} | Symposium: Current state of data engineering in research environment |

: "Wishlist" of outreach event "products" we are currently working on,
will work on, or hope to work on.
