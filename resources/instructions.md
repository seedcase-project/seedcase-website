- Education and training

### Purpose and overall description

The Data Science Research Infrastructure Programme aims to create bottom-up
opportunities for open, national data science infrastructures, which are
critical for achieving excellent data science driven research in Denmark. Such
infrastructure is in this context defined as computational infrastructures,
databases and data resources, and data-generating technologies.

The programme also aims to:

- Strengthen _education and training_ in data science.
- Ensure that facilities are _continuously developed and maintained_, also after their implementation.
- _Boost the research environment_, including companies (e.g.,small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and incubators), that cannot invest in this to the same extent.

Infrastructure must **state-of-the-art **and is defined as:

- _Computational_ infrastructures, including supercomputers, GPUs, _storage_, software, etc.
- _Databases and data resources, including data collection, cleaning, annotation, integration, management, etc._
- Includes building and maintenance of existing databases if it promotes _collaboration_ and _FAIR_ (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles, as well as _secure_ and _ethical_ use of such data.

### Assessment criteria

1. Scientific need for the infrastructure (locally and nationally). 2.
State-of-the-art of the requested equipment and how widespread its use will be.
    1. _Short explanation of criteria_: For projects mainly concerned with data
    science methods development, it is important that the applicants clearly
    show the relevance for potential future application and impact within life
    science, health science, or biotechnology. Vice versa, projects which have
    their primary focus on application of data science methods must describe and
    explain the novelty and impact of their data science approach, be it
    development of novel methods or novel applications of existing methods.
2. Scientific and managerial qualifications of the applicant. 4. Scientific
qualifications of core collaborators. 5. Feasibility and suitability of the
proposed organizational set up for the infrastructure, including expected use
and maintenance.
    1. _Short explanation of criteria_: Feasibility and suitability of the
    proposed organizational set up for the infrastructure, including expected
    use and maintenance.
3. Coordination with and/or relevance for other Danish research groups. 7. Plan
for accessibility to the infrastructure for the local and national research
community, including internal, external and industrial users, as well as a
clear plan for how to grant access in an open and transparent manner for
external users.
    1. _Short explanation of criteria_: The infrastructure should be shared with
    the national research community. Priority for funding will be given to
    applications that demonstrate coordination with other Danish research
    groups.
4. The applicant’s and/or collaborators’ plan to actively participate in, and
direct, educational or training courses in data science in Denmark, leveraging
on the proposed infrastructure.

### Areas of support

The infrastructure must be linked to ongoing research and be within the scope
of the NNF Data Science Initiative:

1. Development of new ... methods and technologies within data science, ...,
data engineering, ...

For projects mainly concerned with data science methods development, it is
important that the applicants clearly show the relevance for potential future
application and impact within life science, health science, or biotechnology.

### Eligibility

- Infrastructure linked to ongoing research and applicants must document
expertise at the highest level.
- Must be established at a research institution with expertise within the
relevant field to ensure that the infrastructure can _develop in parallel with
the scientific progress_ in the area, and that there are qualified personnel to
operate and maintain the equipment/facility.
- _Infrastructure should be shared_ with the national research community.
Priority for funding will be given to applications that demonstrate coordination
with other Danish research groups.
- Applications to maintain or expand existing infrastructures are eligible.
- Funding may be requested for _skilled technical staff_ that can offer
research-based training, consultation, data processing, data analysis, data
management, software/database development, and dissemination of data/tools.

### Funding

DKK 1-3 million on average per year over 5 years, for a total of DKK 5-15
million. Can apply for **skilled personnel** anchored in a specific institution
and linked to ongoing research, as well as for personnel that can offer
_research-based training, consultation, data processing_, data analysis, _data
management, software/database development, and dissemination of data/tools._

    - Training for running and maintaining the infrastructure, including travel
    and accommodations.
    - Data management, e.g. expenses for collecting and storing data.
