{{< include /includes/_wip.qmd >}}

-   To create a stand-alone fully functioning database which can be
    modified by any given researcher to contain the dataset (or
    datasets) they are working with

    -   It must be built using open source technology
    -   It should be able to work as a distributed model where
        collaborators from different geographical locations can work on
        the same dataset simultaneously if needed

-   To build a community around the project based on the open decision
    framework

    -   It should be open to both technical and non-technical users as
        well as people who would like to contribute because they think
        the project is an interesting challenge

-   Not only will we build these tools to help researchers with managing
    and sharing their data, we also will create them with
    beginner-friendly documentation and training material to make sure
    more researchers use our tools, no matter their skill level.
