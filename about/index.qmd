## Who we are

The Seedcase project is developed by the four of us at the Steno
Diabetes Center Aarhus and Department of Clinical Medicine at Aarhus
University in Aarhus, Denmark, and is funded by a five year grant from
the Novo Nordisk Foundation.

## Why we build Seedcase

In clinical and health research, especially for small- to mid-sized
research groups, funding for building modern, open source software
infrastructures for managing and using data is limited. This lack of
funding has naturally led to organizational challenges for managing
existing and incoming data for many research initiatives, including the
Danish Centre for Strategic Research in Type 2 Diabetes (DD2) initiative
[@Nielsen2012; @DD2], a national research collaboration and database
initiative established in 2010 with continual enrollment of persons with
type 2 diabetes. DD2 is one of our collaborators and key stakeholders of
Seedcase.

We hope that Seedcase will improve and extend the existing DD2 research
infrastructure into an open national state-of-the-art research
infrastructure that will provide easy and transparent access to this
resource for researchers, clinicians and stakeholders, thus enabling
excellent data science driven research. Within the DD2 setting, an open,
transparent, and easy access to this constantly growing resource has the
potential of greatly improving the interest in, use of, and scientific
impact of this resource, thus leading to substantial scientific and
medical advancements, individualised treatment and improved human health
in not only persons with type 2 diabetes, but population overall.

Seedcase will not be limited to only DD2. Our **secondary aim** to
create this framework in such a way that other research groups and
companies, who are unable to adequately invest in building
infrastructures of this type, can relatively easily implement it, and
modify as needed, for their own purposes. By building this framework, we
hope to help propel research groups and companies across Denmark (and
globally) to quickly getting updated on modern, scalable, and efficient
approaches to working with data.
