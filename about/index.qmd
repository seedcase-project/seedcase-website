## Who we are

The Seedcase Project is developed by the four of us at the Steno
Diabetes Center Aarhus and Department of Clinical Medicine at Aarhus
University in Aarhus, Denmark, and is funded by a five year grant from
the [Novo Nordisk Foundation](/index.qmd#acknowledgements).

## What motivated the Seedcase Project

In clinical and health research, especially for small- to mid-sized
research groups, funding for building modern, open-source software
infrastructures for managing and using data is limited. This lack of
funding has naturally led to organisational challenges in managing both
existing and incoming data for many research initiatives.

In the Seedcase Project, we aim to improve research infrastructure by
providing tools that ease the management of research data resources and
improve transparency for researchers, clinicians, and stakeholders.
Managing data is hard and can easily become time-consuming and complex.
With the Seedcase Project, we want to provide a framework for managing
data in a way that is scalable, efficient, and easy to use---while also
being open source and transparent. This will allow researchers to spend
more time on actual research by minimising the time spent on data
management.

More open, transparent, and easy access to data resources has the
potential to greatly improve the interest in, use of, and scientific
impact of those resources, enabling excellent data science-driven
research.

We aim to create this framework in a way that enables diverse research
groups and companies who are unable to adequately invest in building
infrastructures of this kind to implement it relatively easily and
modify it as needed for their own purposes. By building this framework,
we hope to help propel research groups and companies across Denmark (and
globally) toward modern, scalable, and efficient approaches to working
with data.
