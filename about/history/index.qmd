title: History of the project
---

In clinical research, software and data infrastructure development is
undervalued and generally underfunded, particularly for small- to
mid-sized research organizations. Clinical and health researchers
largely lack formal training, support, and awareness in research
software and/or data engineering and in building and managing data
infrastructures. The result? The overall software and computational
ecosystem, as well as the technical capacities to maintain them, lags
far behind multiple other scientific domains (e.g., bioinformatics).

Combined with the recent rise of data science and the greater focus on
analytical reproducibility, this issue has become increasingly apparent
as data, and the skills required to work with it, become ever larger,
more technical, and complex. In fact, investing in and implementing
scalable and modern data infrastructures as well as software and data
engineering processes, built with open source software, have the
potential to greatly improve the quality of science, to produce more
transparent and streamlined workflows, to lead to reproducible research,
and generally better science in less time [@Lowndes2017].

Thankfully, building modern data infrastructures has slowly been taking
greater priority by funding and research agencies globally. For
instance, the UK Biobank [@Sudlow2015; @UKBiobank] is a large-scale
biomedical database with highly detailed data on \~500,000 participants.
It is regularly expanded with additional data and is globally accessible
to approved researchers and is a role model to building a functioning
research data infrastructure.

While the UK Biobank is a source of inspiration, the underlying
infrastructure itself is not openly accessible and reusable. The same
applies to a similar Danish initiative, the "*Single path to access
Danish health data*" project [@sundhedsdata], where the Danish
government and individual regions are collaborating to map out all
Danish health data. Another state-of-the-art initiative led by the
University of Chicago, USA is Gen3 [@gen3], which contains modular open
source services that can form the basis for a data infrastructure
[@ctds; @gen3software] and powers several research platforms, including
the National Institutes of Health [@gen3platform]. However, we are
unaware of any similar current national efforts that are open source,
re-usable, and suitable for the Danish and EU legal context.

In light of this background, the idea of Seedcase initially formed out
of a need to improve the data infrastructure of the [Danish Centre for
Strategic Research in Type 2 Diabetes (DD2)](https://dd2.dk/) study
[@Christensen2018]. We expanded the idea and generalized the idea to
improve not only DD2, but also the infrastructure of other Danish
studies.

The NovoNordiskFonden in Denmark had an grant application call titled
*Data Science Research Infrastructure Grant* in 2021, of which we've
included a modified version of the instructions
[here](nnf-instructions.md). We submitted an
[application](nnf-application.html) for it that resulted in receiving
the requested funds.
