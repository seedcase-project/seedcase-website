### Purpose and overall description

The Data Science Research Infrastructure Programme aims to create
bottom-up opportunities for open, national data science infrastructures,
which are critical for achieving excellent data science driven research
in Denmark. Such infrastructure is in this context defined as
computational infrastructures, databases and data resources, and
data-generating technologies.

The programme also aims to:

-   Strengthen *education and training* in data science.
-   Ensure that facilities are *continuously developed and maintained*,
    also after their implementation.
-   *Boost the research environment*, including companies (e.g.,small
    and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and incubators), that cannot
    invest in this to the same extent.

Infrastructure must **state-of-the-art** and is defined as:

-   *Computational* infrastructures, including supercomputers, GPUs,
    *storage*, software, etc.
-   *Databases and data resources, including data collection, cleaning,
    annotation, integration, management, etc.*
-   Includes building and maintenance of existing databases if it
    promotes *collaboration* and *FAIR* (Findable, Accessible,
    Interoperable, Reusable) principles, as well as *secure* and
    *ethical* use of such data.

### Assessment criteria

1.  Scientific need for the infrastructure (locally and nationally). 2.
    State-of-the-art of the requested equipment and how widespread its
    use will be.
    1.  *Short explanation of criteria*: For projects mainly concerned
        with data science methods development, it is important that the
        applicants clearly show the relevance for potential future
        application and impact within life science, health science, or
        biotechnology. Vice versa, projects which have their primary
        focus on application of data science methods must describe and
        explain the novelty and impact of their data science approach,
        be it development of novel methods or novel applications of
        existing methods.
2.  Scientific and managerial qualifications of the applicant. 4.
    Scientific qualifications of core collaborators. 5. Feasibility and
    suitability of the proposed organizational set up for the
    infrastructure, including expected use and maintenance.
    1.  *Short explanation of criteria*: Feasibility and suitability of
        the proposed organizational set up for the infrastructure,
        including expected use and maintenance.
3.  Coordination with and/or relevance for other Danish research
    groups. 7. Plan for accessibility to the infrastructure for the
    local and national research community, including internal, external
    and industrial users, as well as a clear plan for how to grant
    access in an open and transparent manner for external users.
    1.  *Short explanation of criteria*: The infrastructure should be
        shared with the national research community. Priority for
        funding will be given to applications that demonstrate
        coordination with other Danish research groups.
4.  The applicant's and/or collaborators' plan to actively participate
    in, and direct, educational or training courses in data science in
    Denmark, leveraging on the proposed infrastructure.

### Areas of support

The infrastructure must be linked to ongoing research and be within the
scope of the NNF Data Science Initiative:

1.  Development of new ... methods and technologies within data science,
    ..., data engineering, ...

For projects mainly concerned with data science methods development, it
is important that the applicants clearly show the relevance for
potential future application and impact within life science, health
science, or biotechnology.

### Eligibility

-   Infrastructure linked to ongoing research and applicants must
    document expertise at the highest level.
-   Must be established at a research institution with expertise within
    the relevant field to ensure that the infrastructure can *develop in
    parallel with the scientific progress* in the area, and that there
    are qualified personnel to operate and maintain the
    equipment/facility.
-   *Infrastructure should be shared* with the national research
    community. Priority for funding will be given to applications that
    demonstrate coordination with other Danish research groups.
-   Applications to maintain or expand existing infrastructures are
    eligible.
-   Funding may be requested for *skilled technical staff* that can
    offer research-based training, consultation, data processing, data
    analysis, data management, software/database development, and
    dissemination of data/tools.

### Funding

DKK 1-3 million on average per year over 5 years, for a total of DKK
5-15 million. Can apply for **skilled personnel** anchored in a specific
institution and linked to ongoing research, as well as for personnel
that can offer *research-based training, consultation, data processing*,
data analysis, *data management, software/database development, and
dissemination of data/tools.*

        several that cover different aspects of the same field or can be
        equipment that is often used sequentially. However, the intent
        is that only larger equipment should be put in the equipment
        budget category.
    -   Infrastructure, i.e.,establishment and installation of the
        infrastructure. This may include minor modifications strictly
        necessary for establishing and operating the infrastructure.
    -   Operating expenses, e.g.:
        -   Materials, consumables, and service contracts directly
            related to operating and maintaining the infrastructure.
        -   Funds for hosting annual networking/outreach events.
        -   Specialised software needed for the infrastructure.
    -   Salary for technical personnel (i.e. AC TAP or TAP). These can
        also offer research-based training, consultation, data
        processing, data analysis, data management, software/database
        development, and dissemination of data/tools. Salary can be used
        for personnel with an academic background but not for conducting
        research.

        -   Such as for accounting, payment of salaries, purchasing,
            hiring, auditing, and financial reporting on the project.
        -   Cannot cover administrative expenses not directly related to
            the project.
